CodePy is a C/C++ metaprogramming toolkit for Python. It helps you compile
source code and dynamically load it into the Python interpreter.
This facility also works in conjunction with with `PyCuda
<http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda>`_.  Dynamic compilation and linking
are so far only supported in Linux with the GNU toolchain.

See also the `documentation <http://documen.tician.de/codepy>`_ and the
